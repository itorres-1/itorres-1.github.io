# Personal website

This is the repository for my personal website on GitHub Pages. Feel free to use any of this code however you'd like :)

## Setup

First, create a GitHub repository with the following name: `<username>.github.io`. Then, once you have pushed the Create React App bootstrapped code to this repo, configure `gh-pages` and all the necessary `package.json` values, then run `npm run deploy`. Then in the GitHub repo, go to Settings -> Pages, ensure `Deploy from a branch` is the selected option under source, you should then see `gh-pages` as a selectable branch to deploy from. Everytime you run `npm run deploy`, you should be able to see all your recent changes within a few minutes on your user GitHub pages site.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production and deploys it to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` branch in your repository. Make sure you've setup your `<username>.github.io` Page to deploy from this branch.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
